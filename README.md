# Magallanes #

### What's Magallanes? ###
Magallanes is a deployment tool for PHP applications; it's quite simple to use and manage.
It will get your application to a safe harbor.


### So, What can it do? ###
You can instruct Magallanes to deploy your code to all the servers you want (via rsync over ssh),
and run tasks for that freshly deployed code.

### How can I install it via composer? ###

Simply add the following dependency to your projectâ€™s composer.json file:

```js
    "require": {
        // ...
        "andres-montanez/magallanes": "dev-master"
        // ...
    }
```
Now tell composer to download the bundle by running the command:

```bash
$ php composer.phar update andres-montanez/magallanes
```

### Can you give me some examples/ideas? ###
**Sure!**
Suppose you have a checkout of your app and you have to deploy it to four servers;
and after each deploy you have to run some boring tasks, like fixing file permissions, creating symlinks, etc.
You can define all this on Magallanes and with *just one command* you can do all this at once!

Like this:
```
$ mage deploy to:production
```


### What's this sorcery?! ###
Easy boy. It's not sorcery, just some *technomagick*!

In Magallanes you define environments like *testing*, *staging*, or *production* like on the example above.
Then, on that environment, you can configure a setup specifing to which hosts you want to deploy and what tasks to run (*after*, *on*, and *before* deploying).
And you are done!


### And what spells... tasks! What tasks has it built in? ###
Just a few, for now...

  - **deployment/rsync** - This task is for deploying your code to the remote servers.
  - **scm/update** - This task is for updating (git/svn) your base working copy.

But that's not all! You can create your own tasks, and execute commands on your working copy and in your deployed code!
Also we are working on creating more built in tasks.


### This is awesome! Where can I learn more? ###
You can read the whole source code (naaah!); or checkout the documentation wiki at: http://magallanes.zenreworks.com/wiki


Enjoy your magic trip with **Magallanes** to the land of the easily deployable apps!!
